    "## Introduction\n",
    "For the collection of job advertisements, I will create various feature representations as part of this task. We will only take into account the job description in this task. The feature representations I'll create are as follow: The count vector representation for each job advertisement description is contained in the bag-of-words model, which I then save it to a file called count_vectors.txt. I will then generate the TF-IDF weighted and unweighted vector representations for each job advertisement description using the GoogleNews300 embedding language model. After that, in Task 3 I will build machine learning models for classifying the category of a job advertisement text. For this particular task I will use the logistic regression model from sklearn. Finally, I will conduct two sets of experiments on the provided dataset to compare the three different language models, then investigate if more information could lead to a higher accuracy."

    "To summarise, in these two tasks, I produced different feature representations while only considering the job description.  I then stored the count vector representation of each job description into a file called `count_vectors.txt`. Then, using the GoogleNews300 embedding language model, I built the TF-IDF weighted and unweighted vector representations for each job advertisement description. Then, for Task 3, I developed machine learning models for categorising the text of a job advertisement. I implemented the logistic regression model from `sklearn` for this specific task. Then, I compared the three different language models using two sets of tests on the provided dataset, and I looked into whether having more information might result in a greater performance of the model."
